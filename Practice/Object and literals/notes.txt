Name/value pair, a name which maps to a vlaue.
- The name may be defined more than once, but only can have
one value in any given context.
That value may be more name/value pairs.


eg: Address: '100 main st.';

::: OBJECT in JS is a collection of name/value pair.:::
Can be nested like on case of JSONs

-Objects sits in memory and points to other objects.
-But functions are special kind of objects.
-Value might be a function. But when a function is attached to
an object is called a method.

BWA: 
Object literal: when typing an object containing key/
value pairs separated by commas, and surrounded by curly 
brases

{
    st: 'main',
    number: '10',
.........
}
