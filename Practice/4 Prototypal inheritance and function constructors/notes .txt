Inheritance: 1 obj (name/value) can access methods and props
name/value. 

A bit different ; called protypal Inheritance.

Eg: obj has prop.. so we access it by obj.prop1

Now, every object has a property that actually points to
another object, its the object's prototype.
Its the thing it inherits from, its a different obj that
it will then have access to that other object's properties
and methods.

obj.prop2, this is accesed as if it is a different object.
Prototype can point to another prototype and that can have 
more properties and obj can point to those props as well
obj.prop3.
so this is proptype chain
obj.prop1 >> obj.prop2 >> obj.prop3

obj2 can point to each prototype.. obj2.prop2


Function constructors, a normal function that is used to 
create objects. this points to new empty object 
and that one is returned automatically.
